# Midterm Project - Stab Magazine Article
## Project Description

This site displays personal knowledge derived from previous exercise on elements such as atomic design and personal css styling. My website is based off a surf media call Stab Magazine, and displays a single article.


## HTML Semantics and Accessibility Compliance

- **Structure**: My site uses semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
  
- **Alt Attributes**: My site has images which include descriptive alt attributes to guarantee accessibility.

- **Color Contrast**: My site uses colors that are in compliance with 508/WCAG color contrast guidelines.
